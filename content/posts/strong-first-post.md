I submited the wrong one. That is my bad. The statement "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management." is what I learned about this week. This week I learned to how to create a post on hugo. I know how to create content and upload content to the website that me and my group members have made throughout the semester. I had no clue what Hugo was before the semester was. I know we will do WordPress soon. I am excited to keep learning WordPress.
