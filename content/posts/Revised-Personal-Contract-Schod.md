A- Reports to all of the meetings in class and outside of class without any excuses. Contributes to the project and add my own flair to our content. Make sure that we're all on track to turn in what we need to. 
B- Have a few excuses but still shows up when I can. Contributes to everything but the content is not as stellar as we'd want it to be. Isn't as easy to communicate with outside of class. 
C- Shows up when needed to class and the online meetings. Contributes but the content is just at the bare minimum of what we can present publicly. Doesn't communicate really outside of when we're in class. 
D- Barely shows up to the required meetings. Contributes to content but does the bare minimum when required. Doesn't communicate outside of class. 
E- Doesn't show up at all, or maybe a couple of times. Doesn't contribute to the project that the group works so hard on. Isn't communicating with the rest of the group outside or in the classroom.
