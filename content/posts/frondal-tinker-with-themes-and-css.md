# Tinker with themes and CSS in hugo
## Christopher Frondal

This week we talked about presentation and construction, meaning how the content management means, in this case a website, is built and how it is displayed. So while our site is constructed in a certain way and contains a certain type of content, another important part of the content management is presentation. This was displayed today in our tinkering activity where we messed around with themes and demonstrated how we can have the same content changed site wide using the theme functionality which utilizes CSS. Also, while this is not a CSS class, this activity was a good introduction to how CSS and other languages can edit existing content dynamically without having to change the core content itself.
