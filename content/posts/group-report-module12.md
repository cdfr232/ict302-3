# Group Report Module 12

This week is a work week for us and we are focusing on dividing out what each group member will address on the wordpress site. We also planned out a new feature that we would like to incorporate via extension if time allows. We plan to add a forum if time allows that would let users ask questions and communicate with other tech security minded community members. Beyond that we discussed more about what kind of visuals and layout we will like the main website to have. So far progress is smooth and we have addressed deadlines for the content we would like to deliver.
