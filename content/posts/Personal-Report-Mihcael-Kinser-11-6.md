I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. This week we talked about extensions and the value that they can add to a website. That could be making it easier to work on the content or something that is for the user that is consuming the content that you are creating. This week specifically we looked at extensions for Hugo and how those could be helpful. I specifically looked at adding a button that take you back to the top of the website for something that would be helpful for someone running a website that has a lot of content. When it comes to looking at our WordPress website I think we briefly talked about adding a forum because that would allow us to have a section for feedback or to even have people bring things to our attention about cybersecurity that may have been missed. Extensions can really enhance features that your website has and I know there are a few that I would potentially want to add to our WordPress site from what we looked at this week in class.
