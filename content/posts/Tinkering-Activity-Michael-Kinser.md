This activity was honestly a bit easier than I though it would be. We knew with cyber security that GitHub would be a good resource to utilize. I added it super easily and didn't run into any issues which was not going what I was expecting. I understand that having those extra places to share content could be beneficial to better reach an audience in different platform or just be able to better reach the original audience using something other than the website we have created.
