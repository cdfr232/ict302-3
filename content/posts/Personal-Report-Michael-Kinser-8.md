I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management. This week we talked about content vs theme and how they are separated. This is so that when editing the whole websites theme you won't necessarily have to change any of the content. You may need to edit certain things to look better but most of the time there is very little to do. This is the way that Hugo works with the posts that we make because you could change the theme and not have to change any of the content if you get a theme that is similar to ananke the them we have been using all semester.
