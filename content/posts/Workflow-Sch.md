1. Bring concept to the team.
2. Debate among team and set roles like writer, editor, and publisher.
3. Open up command prompt and add the new post to your site.
4. Open up a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime and open up your new .md file for the post.
5. In the space below the header, the writer would write as they want. 
6. When they finish writing they should send the content to the editor for them to look over. 
7. Editor would look over the content and look out for any mistakes.
8. Based on how it went, it would either get the draft turned false or sent back to the writer to review their mistakes and remade.
9. If sent back to the editor, it is given another review.
10. At this step everyone else will be able to review it as well to make sure everyone is in agreeance about whether it's good content or not. 
11. From here it is pushed to the github repository through github desktop and then we check our netlify blog site to see the post.
