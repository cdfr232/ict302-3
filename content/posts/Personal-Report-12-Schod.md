- I feel like I can identify concepts such as content which is any medium created for an audience. Content Management is another one I feel comfortable with as it pertains to translating the content into something that people can enjoy as well as streamlining the process. Content aggregation is another concept that I'm planning to employ on our wordpress site as we're gonna have different forms of content from blog-style posts to actual articles.
- I can describe Content management systems. It is something that keeps the editorial process of content making in one neat place.  I just was finding out about such tools as Arc, scoop, Clay, and Hearst. Wordpress can also be considered a content management too as well as basecamp. CMS is a systemt that manages the editorial process associated with content. 
- I can manage content using established workflows such as with our group project with hugo. This is exemplified in how we are dealing with our wordpress website right now. We use groupme to communicate as well as making a Microsoft teams group. With wordpress we also have a way for us to work on the smae thing but be able to see what the other is doing almost immediately. I also have been using word to make content for the site without causing any mistakes. 
- I can identify technologies such as basecamp, wordpress, Hugo, Excel, github, Mastodon as well.
- I can use resources for self-learning as that was what we had to do to first set up our hugo pages. I also had to learn on my own how to format the pages on our page.
