 For this first responsee, I'm going to look at the md file that I created on my own site. It was a simple process that involved only using the hugo new post command. When you open the file, it will be a .md file and I'll notice off the bat that it's .yaml from the fact that it uses "---" to close and open messages. 
 The attributes were a bit interesting when I was using the -D command. It came up with only four pages and one sitemap, but that is to be expected at the beginning. 
 I think that this helps with what we're learning to do this week because we're learning how to create content on our Hugo sites as relating to the podcast and article we had to read about content creation. It also helps us get a better understanding of the tools we're starting to use.
