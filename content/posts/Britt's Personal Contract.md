I will likely be the person that edits the content on the website. As the editor, I would imagine the grading scale to look like this. 

A - Make sure they are no mistakes with the content. That can be through the pictures, articles, topics, etc. The website has to be visually appealing and the content is organized. 

B - They are barely any mistakes with the content, the wesbite is visually appealing and the information is organzied. 

C - The website barely has any mistakes, while the website isnt that appealing. The information is organized. 

D - The website has many mistakes while the information is barely organzied and the website is not appealing. 

E - The website is full of mistakes and is the opposite of appealing with the information not organized and placed in the wrong spots.
