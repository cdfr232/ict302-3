	Our group is very diverse and has a lot of skills that add to it. For me, I will be adding coding as well as creative expertise to make our website the best that it can be as well as being as social as I can with my fellow group members. 
A- Puts forth a lot of effort and makes posts that benefit the group and it's grade
B- Puts forth effort, but isn't able to provide the best content that can be produced.
C- Effort that isn't the best, but acceptable for the work presented. Could use improvement.
D- Below average work that reflects badly on the group but still gets the job done.
E- Abysmal work that reflects badly on the group and would not be acceptable in a academic environment.
