# Tinker With Other CMSs
## Christopher Frondal

Since I have gained an interest in tech related stuff in middle school I have had the opportunity to tinker with a few different CMSs either on my own or for school work. 
Some of the most prominent ones I have used were Google sites, Wix, and Dreamweaver. With all of those being more of product-like web development software they are pretty comparable to wordpress, although I probably prefer Dreamweaver over them all. 
These CMSs are probably moreso intended for general web content instead of more complex roles like database management however im not sure to the extend Dreamweaver supported management tasks since its been a while. My preference between the bunch would have to be the ui, for what I have done so far the features I would use would be pretty similar between the bunch but it looks like adding extensions to wordpress would definitely be the easiest.
Im probably least impressed with the web based CMSs of Google sites and Wix which is unsurprising considering they are meant for their simplicity, but I also just dont really like the ui on wordpress because it seems oversimplified and feels a little gimmicky to edit individual elements on the webpage.
