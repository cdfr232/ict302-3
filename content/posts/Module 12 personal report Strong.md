This week, I used "I can describe and compare content systems." This week we learned about user-generated content and content moderation. I brought up an example about Twitch because I am a streamer myself, so having mods is super important. On Wendesday we worked on getting content for my groups website. We have an idea of what we have to do and hopefully we get that done soon.
