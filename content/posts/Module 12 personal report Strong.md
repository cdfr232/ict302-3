This week, I used "I can find and use resources for self-directed learning" This week we discussed user-generated content that talks about comments and forums. In the lecture, we also discussed about content moderation. I brought up an example about Twitch because I am a streamer myself, so having mods is super important. On Wednesday we worked on getting content for the website. We have an idea of what we have to do and hopefully we get that done soon. We split up the content and now we are working seperately and then we will meet up and put it together.
