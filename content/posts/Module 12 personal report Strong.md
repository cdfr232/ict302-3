This week, I used "I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management" This week we discussed user-generated content that talks about comments and forums. In the lecture, we also discussed about content moderation. When i think about content moderation, i think of a person that keeps an eye on something to make sure nothing goes wrong. I picked this I can statement because moderation can be useful in many ways like a Twitch chat or someone that runs a website. User-generated content is also a relatable topic because there are some content out there that is not made by a user. On Wednesday we worked on getting content for the website. We have an idea of what we have to do and hopefully we get that done soon. We split up the content and now we are working seperately and then we will meet up and put it together.
