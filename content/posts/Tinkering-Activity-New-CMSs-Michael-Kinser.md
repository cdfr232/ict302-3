The CMS that I am going to look over today is Alfresco Software. This is a  very business oriented CMS that for windows and it uses java. This CMS is mainly for carrying out business analytics and other tasks that help the company control their data in a organized way. They do have the option to host on your own or to have it hosted by them through Amazon web services. The main differences between this a Wordpress is that this software doesn't really seem interested in posting this to a website but rather keeping it internal. Wordpress also very much a website builder as is made for making a website and creating content for that website. With Hugo the differences are very similar as this is not a CMS to post things on w website but to control and manage data internally. I think I would really only have a use for this CMS if I was running a business or if a company I was working for wanted me to us it but other than that it would be pretty useless for anything that I would be looking to use a CMS for.
