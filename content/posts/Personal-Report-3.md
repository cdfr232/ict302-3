- I feel like I can identify concepts such as content which is any medium created for an audience. Content Management is another one I feel comfortable with as it pertains to translating the content into something that people can enjoy as well as streamlining the process.
- I can't say that I can describe or compare content management systems yet.
- I can manage content using established workflows such as with our group project with hugo.
- I can identify technologies such as basecamp, wordpress(not employ), Hugo, Excel, and github to name a few.
- I can use resources for self-learning as that was what we had to do to first set up our hugo pages.
