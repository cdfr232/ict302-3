# Group Report for Module 6

This week we were introduced and got our hands on wordpress for the first time. We got the chance to tinker with it and translate what we have learned on hugo thus far to the new platform. 
When working with wordpress we noticed that its a lot easier to make a nice looking site, which should be good for making the high quality content that we defined in our group contract per the grading scale.
In the tinkering assignment as mentioned earlier we were able to match our wordpress skills to what we know in hugo, and starting now and going forward our friday meetings will be dedicated to developing the group website.
