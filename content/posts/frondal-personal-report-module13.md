# Personal Report for Module 13
## Christopher Frondal

I can describe and compare different content management systems. This week we talked about content management systems features where part of the discussion included things like CMS feature metrics, platform vs product, and installed programs vs System as a Service. A big part of the discussion was the comparison between our two focused CMS' being wordpress and hugo which offer some key differences. 
Some of said comparisons were where hugo and wordpress sit on the spectrum between platform and product, and in our tinkering activity I laid out how I think both are somewhere in the middle but I think hugo leans farther towards being a platform. Another part of the CMS features discussion was installed vs SaaS where an installed CMS would be stuff like what we are working with where the whole suite is downloaded to your computer/server and you are responsible for building it and hosting it yourself like with our hugo and wordpress sites. On the other hand a SaaS CMS website would be something like google sites or wix, just something that is less 'analog' where instead of a one time up from payment(or none) you will be dealing with continuous payments for another company to handle the hosting and/or maintenance of the site.
