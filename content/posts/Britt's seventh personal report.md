This week, I used "I can describe and compare content systems." This is the same as last week. This week, started to get the hang of WordPress. Still believe its better than Hugo by a long shot. Started getting our ideas down and what the plan is. I will be working on the content for the site. Cannot wait to get fully started after finishing the design of the website.
