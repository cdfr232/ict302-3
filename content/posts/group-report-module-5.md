# Group Report for Module 5

This week we learned about how overall content management systems come together, in in that we made a practice content management system through hugo on Wednesday for our tinkering activity.
While doing that activity we learned just how much extra work and how non developer/user friendly the hugo development platform is when compared to something like wordpress. Developing and assembling through hugo is just adding a lot more work and thus a lot more time to the development process.
Essentially what we learned this week was; while we have the ability to develop through hugo, we really don't want/need to while platforms like wordpress exist.
