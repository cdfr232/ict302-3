As i missed class today, my group let me know about this tinkering assignment. So here is my workflow based on the prompt. 

First, idea will be brought by a person on the team. Second, figure the roles out and say what every role does. Third, start creating a draft. Fourth, create the file that the content is going to be on. Fifth, produce the content and get ready for to send it to the editor. Sixth, send the content to the editor. Seventh, editor will look over the content and improve it (if needed). Eighth, reviewing of content after the editor gets done editing. Ninth, the final look at the content. Tenth, finally it would be time to publish the content.
