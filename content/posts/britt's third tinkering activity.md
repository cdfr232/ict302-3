This tinkering activity brought us to think of ideas to start getting our ideas ready to start on our website. Talked about virsuses and we said that will be a great thing to add to the website. I added my files to a local server to see if it worked. They are related to what we learned this week while thinking about the different CMSs. This is way different than Wix. I use Wix a lot. Also learned that Hugo is crazy hard and I cannot wait to use WordPress. Working on the drafts help me get better with hugo and will get me more ready to work on our website. Still do not want to use Hugo though.
