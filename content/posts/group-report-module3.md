#Group Report Module 3

Over the past few weeks, we have been able to get a lot more done than we thought we would be able to at this point. For starters, we were able to make the repository for our group within a short span of time. We have also been able to get in contact with each other through GroupMe. Not only that, but we have also been able to jot down the idea that we have for our website which is cybersecurity. One thing that is going less than well is getting the criteria defined.
