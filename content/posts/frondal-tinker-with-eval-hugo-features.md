# Tinker with Evaluating Hugo Features
## Christopher Frondal

When it comes to content management systems and their features there are two main categories to define CMS's by how they are delivered and their associated features. Ultimately defining a CMS as either a platform or a product is not necessarily binary as one or the other, but it is more of a range between the two depending on how the program is built and delivered.
With that in mind I would consider hugo to be somewhere in the middle but leaning towards the platform side, because while hugo can function on its own out of the box it really requires a lot of work and influence form the end developer in order to stck modules onto it and make the desired website with the required features for its purpose. 
This when compared to to other web development platforms such as wordpress or dreamweaver which have much more content pre-installed and ready for utilization out of the box, hugo requires a lot more work and development from the end developer. 

To continue with CMS core features, hugo could easily be defined as open source, and is openly stated as just that go the gohugo.io website. Hugo development is community driven whether that be between core features or community add on extensions that are uploaded for everyone to pick and choose from themselves for their individual sites.

Further on with the subject of delivery methods, hugo is best defines as an installed program as opposed to a SaaS. Hugo is all delivered via download which the end user gets the entire suite for which to develop from their own machine. This is how hugo works as opposed to SaaS website development tools such as google sites or wix which are all hosted by the content host and are not developed manually on the developers local machine.
