# Group Report for Module 7
This week we learned about integrations and handles for social media. We practiced this in the group tinkering on wednesday when we added a github integration to our hugo website. 
While practicing adding the social media integration we learned about the navigation bar and how that works in hugo, which is a separate file that is referenced so that it will be visible in every page of the website.
While we werent required to, we went ahead and pushed the social media integration to the live group site since we will be wokring with that and the navigation bar next week where we will hopefully push a more refined and visually appealing version of the site.
