This week, I used "I can identify and employ technologies related to content management." We talked about what extensions or plug-ins we could add to our hugo website and the wordpress website. I looked at the search and comment plug-ins while doing the tinkering activity. I believe those could be useful for almost every website. Extensions is the make and break of any website. When looking towards our own Wordpress website. We discussed a potential comments/feedback section. I believe it would fit perfect in our website.
