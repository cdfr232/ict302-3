I will likely be the person that edits the content on the website. As the editor, I would imagine the grading scale to look like this. 

A - Make sure they are no mistakes with the content. That can be through the pictures, articles, topics, etc. The website has to be visually appealing and the content is organized.Making sure i attend the meetings out of class and in class. The assigned work is done on time and correct.

B - They are barely any mistakes with the content, the wesbite is visually appealing and the information is organized. Assigned work is done on time and attends meetings. 

C - The website barely has any mistakes, while the website isnt that appealing. The information is organized. Assigned work is done but not on time and attends almost every meeting. 

D - The website has many mistakes while the information is barely organzied and the website is not appealing. Assigned work does not get completed and attends half of the meetings. 

E - The website is full of mistakes and is the opposite of appealing with the information not organized and placed in the wrong spots. Assigned work does not get completed and never attends the meetings.
