Never knew there was so many themes, i found it pretty cool that they were many options. Many of the themes i ran did not work until i actually put content on the specific theme. I used three different ones and they all looked good. When comparing this activity to social media and presentation. The presentation of the theme is super important. You have to have a cool design to draw people to your website. Then the content you put on the website. You can promote that content in different ways. Depending on the certain social media platform.
