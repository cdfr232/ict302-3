- I feel like I can identify concepts such as content which is any medium created for an audience. Content Management is another one I feel comfortable with as it pertains to translating the content into something that people can enjoy as well as streamlining the process.
- I can describe Content management systems. It is something that keeps the editorial process of content making in one neat place.  I just was finding out about such tools as Arc, scoop, Clay, and Hearst. Wordpress can also be considered a content management too as well as basecamp. CMS is a systemt that manages the editorial process associated with content. 
- I can manage content using established workflows such as with our group project with hugo.
- I can identify technologies such as basecamp, wordpress, Hugo, Excel, and github to name a few.
- I can use resources for self-learning as that was what we had to do to first set up our hugo pages.
