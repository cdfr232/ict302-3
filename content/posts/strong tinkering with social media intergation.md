I got the LinkedIn "share" button to work on my local server. No clue if we will end up using LinkedIn but i know it works. The related code was in the config file as well. I found it pretty simple to use, I will continue to work with this. Everything seems to be okay so far. Especially adding a navigation bar to the website. I know Twitter and LinkedIn the best. It will be interesting to use other content channels like Reddit.
