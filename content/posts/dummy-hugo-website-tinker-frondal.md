# Group Dummy Hugo Website Tinkering Activity
## Christopher Frondal

In our Tinkering activity we outlined and built a draft of what our main website may look like. We listed four main pages that we will build which will have articles on key subjects related to personal privacy online.

The four pages that we decided to include was an About page, a Threats page, a Tools page, and a News page. The About page will basically discuss what the premise of the website is and introduce what each page will talk about. Also just describe the whole premise of the site. The threats page will outline and descibe potential threats to users personal safety and security online.
The third main page on our website will be a tools page, which will identify, describe, and link tools for users to use in personal privacy. The last page we planned out will be a news page, that links and discusses recent online security related news that users may find important.
