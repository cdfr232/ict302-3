I can manage content using established workflows. The main focus of the week was to work on the content for the WordPress, that is the true main focus of the group right now. When comparing the benefits and drawbacks of each CMS we are working with. By doing the tinkering activity, i figured out that we should be using Wix because its easier to create blogs on there and that is what we are doing. We have created a workflow that is more individual. It is like, one person writes, one person reviews it, and then the person that reviews it will publish it.
