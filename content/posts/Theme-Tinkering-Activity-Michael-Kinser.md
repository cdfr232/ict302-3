This week we talked about how the theme of a site stays constant while the content may change. On our Hugo site the theme Ananke is a completely different file from the content that we type up for each assignment meaning we can change those files and the theme or what the website looks like won't change much at all. The only thing that would change would be the words that we typed in the document we uploaded. For this activity I changed the theme to see how that would change what the website looked like and obviously it did change a lot. I changed it to Hugo Winston. This seemed like a very basic theme and very similar to Ananke. This was true and as we talked about in class on Monday this only changed what the website looked like and not the content that we had already posted. I will say that the content was not as easy to find but it had all the main components we had implemented with the other theme like the title and then the actual post itself.
