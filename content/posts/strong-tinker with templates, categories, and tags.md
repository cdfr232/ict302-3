This weeks tinkering activity taught me how to use templates, categories, and tags within Hugo. After looking at things, I have to really appreciate how much work people put in behind the scenes because it is a lot. I am so happy we do not have to deal with template with WordPress. I feel like that would be worse. When comparing this activity to content aggreation, I would say it would be the grouping of the posts. When working on the tags, nothing chnages expect the tags related to the content.
