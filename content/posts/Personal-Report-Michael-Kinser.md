I can compare and describe content management systems. I chose this one again because this week we really learned more about WordPress and how it works. We started making our site and designing it in our own way. While I can't say that this went super well it showed us more about how it works and how we can manipulate the site to look how we want. We are still figuring out a lot of things but it is still much easier than Hugo even with this learn curve at the very beginning.
