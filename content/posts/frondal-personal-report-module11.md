# Personal Report for Module 11
## Christopher Frondal

I can identify and employ technologies related to content management systems. The focus for module 11 was extending content management systems, this is where you might add features and content to existing content management systems. We discussed plugins for wordpress and extensions for hugo and how we might implement them and what use they would offer to increase the useability of the website. When discussing the group wordpress site we mentioned the possibility of adding a forum feature that would allow the discussion and sharing of relevant topics to cybersecurity. On the hugo side of things we tinkered with adding a search function and looked at the available extensions, it was interesting to see how for larger enterprise sites required linking the search to an external server for the processing of large queries via a paid service from several providers. Although in the case of our site we would not need such measures due to the small scale and small reservoir of content when compared to enterprise sites like major retailers or streaming services.
