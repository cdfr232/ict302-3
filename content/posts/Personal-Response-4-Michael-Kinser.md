This week I can manage content using established workflows. This week we worked on getting our workflow set up. I think even without fully establishing everyones roll we all work together well to get done what we need to whether that is a simple response or coming up with our own groups workflow. Naturally we sort of came up with one on our own by just making sure we got those first few assignments done. Now this workflow we have now more than likely will need tweaking so that we can make even more efficient and get things more organized but I feel that as a group we are all working together well and will continue to make the workflow better.
