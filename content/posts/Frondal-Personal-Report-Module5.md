# Personal Report for Module 5
## Christopher Frondal
 I can describe and compare content management systems. This week we learned about and made our first delve into not only wordpress(introduction, we haven't started using it yet), but also with building website prototypes in hugo. In our tinkering activity we were able to actually see how much work it takes to build a website from scratch with hugo or other similar development methods. In doing this we learned the importance of efficiency when it comes not only to time but also method, meaning that using a more user friendly web development software like wordpress would not only reduce development time but also help to deliver a more stable end product with less possibility of issues in things like syntax and delivery. 
 Overall hugo is an interesting albeit bare bones platform that surely has its uses, but for most people and even big companies like facebook wordpress is a much more accessible and useful platform for which to build a website and manage content.
