# Tinker with templetes, categories, and tags in hugo
## Christopher Frondal
This week we are talking about content aggregation which is all about the managing and pulling of content from a larger reservoir. 
This was done by using the layouts function which contains templates for various types of website designed pre-built into the ananke theme.
These templates are a quick and standardized way to organize content in a few different ways depending on the content you want contained within the site,
which is good for the rapid usage and organization of a large amount of content. 

Unfortunately I was not able to make it into class today because I was not feeling well. That being said, what was perhaps the most important function the group worked with today
was tags, which are a way to mark specific content in order to organize different posts into like categories for easier reference later on.
I was able to tinker with tags a little while I was at home in the local site, but our main group site had some issues between tags and templates so I reverted the changes so netlify could deploy the new posts. 
Tags and templates are probably something we should practice with more going forward to better streamline the process.
