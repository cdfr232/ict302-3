This week I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. This is the same one that I chose last week but I believe that I'm still learning how to efficiently use the systems we are working with. While I didn't make any ground breaking improvements in what I can and can't do I did get more comfortable with it and am now able to efficiently make posts and edit them with little to no concern if it will actually work or not. This is super helpful for later assignments and just progressing through the semester and being able to directly build off of what I learned in the first few weeks of class and what I will learn throughout the semester.
