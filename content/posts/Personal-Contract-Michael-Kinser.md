This is going to be all about communication for me. I'm going to help out with pretty much every step of the process to make sure that it gets done and to a degree that will be acceptable and look good on the website. I will communicate with my groups members if I need to miss a class or will not be able to make a meeting and if so be able to set apart time later on or before to work and get things ready for the next day or next meeting. I will get work done in a timely manner and try to make it ready without the need for much editing from other group members. 
 
A- would be communicating with group members the best that I can to get the work done in a timely manner. B- Communicating well but may not be in a timely manner. C- Not being very transparent about missing class time or group work meetings. D- Would be lack of good communication, may be responding/going to class but doing nothing of value. F- Little to now communication at all and not showing up to class.
