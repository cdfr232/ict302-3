This showed me that I can create this local server on my computer and edit it only locally. While I'm doing this my group members can do the same type of editing or more on their local server. Once we are all finished we can upload that to then be able to see it on the website that we are creating/editing. This is done through a text editing program that once you save it will automatically upload to the local server. Once you complete that document you can then upload the work to GitHub which will sync it with my group members work.
