I can describe and compare content management systems. I chose this one this week because we learned about a different kind of content management system. We have looked at Hugo and now are being introduced to WordPress. I know a bit about Hugo and how it works and that it is a bit of a difficult CMS. I also know some but not a lot about WordPress and that it is one of the most popular CMS's and that it is much easier to use. I find this exciting to get into a new CMS that is going to be easier to use and allow us to do more with much less effort.
