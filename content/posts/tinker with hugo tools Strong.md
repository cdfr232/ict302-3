I think implementing a search bar and a comment section would be a great addition to most Hugo websites. Whil thinking of my groups website. I think it would be smart to add it in there. Because searching certain things are tough and it would be easier to comment in something on the website instead of somewhere else. Now when comparing the search and comments sections to the websites on Hugo showcase. I believe websites like Digital.gov and 1Password Support are an example of a website that can have a search bar and a comments section. I believe these websites do a great job of extending content because you can search for things on the website and it will pop up.
