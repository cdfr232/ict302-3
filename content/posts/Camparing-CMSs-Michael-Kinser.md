Making a new post in WordPress is significantly easier. When looking at how you create content on the port it is much more intuitive as you can visualize what it will look like once you are done right in WordPress. Another thing that I noticed right off the bat was that it doesn't make you physically make a file and save it to your computer. It does all of that behind the scenes in databases that it has. It also it super nice to be able to see images, tables, etc and visualize what that may look like on the website without publishing it and staying in WordPress. Beyond that simply put everything seems to work much more smoothly and be more simple in WordPress rather than Hugo from creating the document all the way to publishing something to the website.
