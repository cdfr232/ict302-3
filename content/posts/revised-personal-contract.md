# Revised Personal Contract
## Christopher Frondal

In this course and on the upcoming projects I intend to deliver quality work in a timely manner that demonstrates what I have learned thus far in the course. I will be able to reflect and reference key parts of the course material to demonstrate my comprehension of course content and I will be able to make timely and meaningful contributions to the greater group project. My believed grade standards are as follows:

A - All directions of assignment are completed on time and is quality work that demonstrates not only an understanding of the course content but also a willingness to deliver beyond what is just required.
B - All directions of the assignment are completed on time and all work is thorough enough to meet the directions to a good standard for the assignment.
C - Most if not all directions completed for the assignment but may have some issues meeting requirements whether that be for the assignment or submission time per course policies.
D - Some directions of the assignment are completed to a low standard and the assignment may or may not be on time.
E - Failure to deliver on the assignment and course requirements with a lack of understanding of the content.
