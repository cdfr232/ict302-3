At this point in the semester, we have been meeting our deadlines and communicating thoroughly with each other in matters such as attendance and bugfixing. The wordpress site is getting super close to getting done.  We are currently finishing up the content so we can start closing down and finishing up wbhat we are doing on the website. After we put the content on the website, we will have a meeting to determine what needs to be changed/fixed. We are very close to giving it a A but we are giving ourselves a B just because the website is not fully done yet. After adding the content and finishing the final touches to the website, we will discuss more after that.
