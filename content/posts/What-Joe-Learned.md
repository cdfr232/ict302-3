		<h1> About Myself</h1>
		<p> My name is Joseph and I'm currently a senior at UK. I find that I enjoy many things. First, I like to play lots of video games; gaming is one of my favorite past times. Right now I'm playing Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but I'm also playing quite a few more always. I also like going out and doing things with my friends whether it be going somewhere to eat and drink or just going to the movies. </p>
		<p> There is more to me rather than just what I like though, I am from somewhere! I came to UK from Louisville, so I live here in Kentucky, but I'm originally from D.C. I moved to Kentucky when I was 14 years old
