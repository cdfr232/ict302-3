## About Myself

My name is Joseph and I'm currently a senior at UK. I find that I enjoy many things. First, I like to play lots of video games; gaming is one of my favorite past times. Right now I'm playing Assassin's Creed Valhalla, but I'm also playing quite a few more always. I also like going out and doing things with my friends whether it be going somewhere to eat and drink or just going to the movies. There is more to me rather than just what I like though, I am from somewhere! I came to UK from Louisville, so I live here in Kentucky, but I'm originally from D.C. I moved to Kentucky when I was 14 years old
