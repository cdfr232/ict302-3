I can describe and compare content management systems. This week we talked about another CMS that was created by someone who need to use a specific feature that others CMS's didn't have. Instead of creating an add on he decided that it would be easier to make his own which he did. I really thought it was interesting hearing his story and why he was actually creating and keeping up with this for him and others to use. From there I have learned more about other CMS's that are potential options to use but specifically how much there are. This was something that suprised me because I kinda thought there couldn't really be that much of a difference between them all. That along with the interview that we watched showed me how each one has things that its good at or may be more useful for different types of content creation.
