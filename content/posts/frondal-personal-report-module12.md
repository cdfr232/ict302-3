# Personal Report for Module 12
## Christopher Frondal
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning: This week discussed user generated content such as comments, reviews, and forums and while we did not have a tinkering activity on wednesday I still used my free time after discussing the group work to tinker around in hugo by adding a comments section on every page on my test hugo site. I did this by finding and following a guide I found online and editing the hugo config file. Also, as our group was already in discussion about potentially adding a forum to our wordpress site I decided to start skimming around and checking what forum extensions were available to wordpress that that would allow the addition of some user generated content on our site.
