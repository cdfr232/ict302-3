- One of the first things that I noticed, and found very useful, was the posting system that they have. It is very intuitive and allows for the user to post whatever they want without having to create a posts folder or go into command prompt and manually type in the post that you want to make. 

- I also found the editing system to be very useful for adding things to posts and pages such as images, URLs, tables, or even quotes specifically. 

- It's very nice to be able to look at how my post will be presented without having to first make it in notepad than hope for the best. 

- It's way easier to actually play around with things because of the saving and draft systems that are included in wordpress.
