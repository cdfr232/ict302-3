The one thing that I found throughout this tinkering activity is that there is a large learning curve for Hugo. I worked most of the class trying to figure out how I could get the website to look even remotely like the sample site. I don't think this makes any sense when there are programs like Wordpress that can make things significantly easier and more efficient. Overall I learned that Hugo quite honestly can be a pain when trying to customize it to look like a regular website that from what everybody is telling me is significantly easier in Wordpress or other programs.
