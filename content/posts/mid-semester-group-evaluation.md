# Mid Semester Group Evaluation
## Group 3

So far things have been going pretty well for us this semester, we have been meeting our deadlines and communicating thoroughly with each other in matters such as attendance and bugfixing. 
The wordpress site is still in its fairly early stages so far but we have a basic layout and are building the site organization based off of the planned site contents we made in one of the earlier group posts.
Nothing on the site is very polished yet or going above and beyond thus far, and it is not considered sub-par by our standards in terms of quality and meeting assignment requirements. 
As such we think we meet the criteria for a B according to our group contract, and we plan to continue steady development of the site as a group and plan to raise the quality of our work to meet what we set as an A standard.
