With this activity I searched all around the templates to try and find a few things that I knew what was going on. I could not really find one where I knew what everything was doing but I found a few things like headers and footers along with some images that are on the title page and things along those lines. With the other part of the activity we worked to try and get the taxonomies to be our names so we could better organize the posts to each person in the group.
