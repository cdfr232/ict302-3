# Tinker and compare hugo with wordpress
## Christopher Frondal

So far the main the things we have learned and done in hugo have been basic file creation for posts, text manipulation, lists, images, and general website organization.
Immediately upon opening wordpress all of these actions are very easy to complete, it functions much like any text editor like word or the google platform. Immediately I was able to adjust text size, font, boldness, and add lists. Adding images is especially easy because its as simple as copy paste, you don't even need to go through any sort of upload process.
Managing drafts vs publishing it openly is also very easy to manage on the top right corner just like hugo but more developer friendly. But most prominently publishing is the biggest change due to not having to go through an upload process and file manipulation through github.
