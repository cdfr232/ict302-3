Taxonomy was a kind of weird thing to learn in Hugo. I found it to be a bit difficult to wrap my head around at first, but later on it got easier for me to understand. What a taxonomy does basically is allow for you to sort your posts on a hugo site according to the tag assigned to it. It basically allows for a new folder to be made to house all of your posts pertaining to a certain subject. It was kind of hard to get the .toml down for it, but we did make some progress on it.
