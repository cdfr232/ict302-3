# Frondal Personal Report for Module 3
I can manage content through established workflows: An important part of module 3 was creating our group contract, where we worked together to define what our grading scale would look like and define what different grades mean as far as content and criteria. To do that, we worked together to discuss what exactly we wold define the 'criteria' as for our project. We settled on Criteria being the all encompassing quality including elements of the project and teamwork such as visuals, organization, timeliness of members, teammate contribution, and assignment requirements. Our team working together on this was an example of establishing our workflows by setting standards and policies that we will follow in the coming weeks for our project.
