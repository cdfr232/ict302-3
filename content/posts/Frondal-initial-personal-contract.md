# Initial Personal Contract
## Christopher Frondal
In this course and on the upcoming projects I intend to deliver quality work in a timely manner that demonstrates what I have learned thus far in the course. My belived grade standards are as follows:

A - All parts of assignment are completed on time and is quality work that demonstrates not only an understanding of the course content but also a willingness to deliver beyond what is just required.
B - All parts of the assignment are completed on time and all work meets all requirements to a good standard for the assignment.
C - Most if not all parts completed for the assignment but may have some issues meeting requirements whether that be for the assignment or submission time.
D - Some parts of the assignment are completed to a low standard and the assignment may or may not be on time.
E - Failure to deliver on the assignment and course requirements with a lack of understanding of the content.
