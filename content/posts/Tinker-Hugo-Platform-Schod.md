I found that Hugo is a CMS implementation tool based on the fact that it can be used in wildly different ways by mutlitple users, whether it's a blog site or a site just for graphs.

Hugo is a platform in how it makes you set up your website from the theme all the way down to the font of text that you want. You could say that it's a product because it only makes one product, but so do a lot of other platforms like R studio or JMP pro. 

I'd say that Hugo is open-source by how you can change the very nature of how it works; you're allowed to get into the nitty gritty of this platform and add just about anything you want or make it look however you want. 

Hugo stacks very well compared to other platforms like wordpress because of how you can throw any plugins you want into your hugo site folder as well as changing the theme of what your site looks like. 

I feel as though Hugo is both a CMS system as well as a delivery system. On our side of it we can have as many tabs(folders) as we want in our posts section to divide the content into the folders that we want them in, making it more organized and easier for us to get to. On the other end, we're making this so someone will eventually consume this content, which would be a delivery system. 

Code features is what explains the way things are implemented in Hugo. Almost everything that I have had to do in Hugo, whether it be wordpress or power terminal, makes me have to write something out before I can implement it. 

Changes through code is also appropriate based on the earlier comment about code features. Any of the big changes I make to our Hugo site I have to do in either wordpress or power terminal. 

Bidirectional publishing is what I think explains the publishing process for a Hugo site. Me and my teammates are able to add anything each of us wants to the hugo site. There are cases where only one person could be working on a hugo site so it becomes more unidirectional, but in our case it's bidirectional publishing. 

Hugo is made for practicality than for elegance. It gives the user an easy and straightforward way to customize their site with the posts they want and plugins they want, sacrificing the elegance of a site compared to say wordpress. 

This is an installed program. I had to use scoop to install it on my laptop as well as I don't pay a service to use it every month.
