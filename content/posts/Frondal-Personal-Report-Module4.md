# Personal Report for Module 4
## Christopher Frondal

I can identify and define key concepts in web content management. This week we talked about content management systems, mainly the roles and associated workflows for managing content online. This week we introduced what exactly content management is, being the general practice of creating and managing a system for the organization of online content. Then in our groups we discussed the hypothetical process a team may go through to create a post for a website withing a content management system. On friday we took the next step in beginning to discuss the roles and workflows our team will use to begin building our website.
