When it comes to the extensions that are on the site given for the assignment I believe that search function would be extremely helpful when it comes to hosting a Hugo site. Since most of the site would be posts being able to maybes each up a date or title of a post would greatly help user experience if maybe they missed a day on a daily blog or just wanted to see if the site had anything about a specific topic. Another really helpful plugin in would be the comments because then readers can bring input to what may be going in the content or even add more if there is something that isn't entirely correct. I think this is something that we will add to our Wordpress site because it is valuable to have input from the audience that is consuming the content that you are creating. 

The website that I looked at is the Hartwell Insurance website and this one seemed to have a few extensions. One right off the bat that caught my eye was that the menu that comes down as you scroll down. This extension makes it look a lot nicer as it is changing as you move, to me this makes the website flow more smoothly and really enhances what the menu is and does. I was also really impressed with the option to bring you back to the top. This is super helpful with websites that have a lot of info and would really make the experience of using the site much nicer.
