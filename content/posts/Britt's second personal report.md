I am choosing I can identify and employ technologirs related to content management. Same one from last week. Was a short week so I will keep it the same as last week. I am stil learning about things in this class. My group and I are still learning github and hugo. I used github for a past geography class, so i had an idea for it. I did not really improve anything this week. Expect learning what our website will be about. This personal report will be great for me this semester.
