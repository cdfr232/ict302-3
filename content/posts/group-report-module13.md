# Group Report for Module 13

This week work continued for our group on adding content for the site and planning the aesthetic features. We discussed deadlines of making sure everyone has their designated content pages implemented in the site by next Wednesday before thanksgiving break. Beyond that we discussed possibly adding a forum extension to the site and decided that is something we will add if time permits but not before all the originally planned content is in and the site navigation/aesthetics are complete. If we meet those deadlines we should be all set for a content complete site with extra time for final edits and tweaks by the project deadline.
