This week we were tasked with changing around the themes of our personal site as well as the files associated with whatever theme we chose.
I found that this was an extrememly straightforward process that just involved downloading the zip file asssociated with the theme then move the unzipped theme folder to my hugo sites theme folder. 
After this you reconfigure the config.toml file to include the new theme as the one you want for your website. chaning around the files in the theme were a bit more chaotic. I found that it broke the site more than helping me change the look of it. 
If this process was better I'd say it's a 10/10, but this helps us learn just how to tinker around with themes in a more forgiving atmosphere.
