Hugo extensions are exactly what I have felt is missing from hugo based on what we have learned so far. Working with hugo so far there have been several times when
 we have had to look back at our old posts for reference in our groupwork on the wordpress website and so on. When doing that I have been really wanting a search function, 
 so I can quickly just jump to whatever we ware talking about or whatever I need to reference rather than wasting time flipping through the pages and pages of individual posts.
 I may actually try to implement this today since it looks like it will be pretty useful. However I was looking at the Bonsai Elastisearch function but it seems like a paid extension
 so we will just stick with the regular indexing posts.
