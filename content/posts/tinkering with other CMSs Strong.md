I decided to look over three different CMSs that i have heard of. The first one being Mambo. Mambo is an open source similar to WordPress. I would never use Mambo because of the lack of extensions. I do like Mambo because they usually have a well established system. 

Onto Omeka, Omkea is also an open source that have seen used by people in my family. I like it because it has collections of books and such. I just would never have a use for it because it is a CMS you would see a libary use. I would not consider them just because they do not fit the need i would need in a CMS. 

And finally Jamroom, this is the one i have less experience with compared to the other two i have talked about. Jamroom is a open source CMS that is community focused. Since you mainly are creating a social network with Jamroom, this is easily a CMS that i would not use. I really just wanted to see what Jamroom was. 

All three of these are similar to WordPress just because they are open-sourced. It is safe to say i would never use them but there is always a chance I may use one of these someday.
