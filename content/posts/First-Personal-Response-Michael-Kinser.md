I can identify and employ technologies related to content management. I learned this week how to properly make a post on Hugo. With that I'm able to create content and upload that to the website that me and my group members have made are going to be editing throughout the semester. This is a skill that I really didn't know how to do before but can now add and contribute to the Hugo website. This for me a is a pretty big step with content management as I had never really done anything like this before but have now been introduced into doing more with content online.
