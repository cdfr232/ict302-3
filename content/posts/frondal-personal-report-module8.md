## Christopher Frondal

I can manage content using established workflows: This week we discussed content and presentation, and how the two main parts of the content of the website and visual means of presentation are two important but distinct parts of content management.
We talked about how sometimes with content management a division of labor between content and presentation can be useful, where one team just focuses on what is said and what is contained in the site/system and another team focuses of the usability/visuals/presentation.
In our tinkering activity for this week we worked with themes and looked at how an entire themes and the CSS characteristics of that theme can be altered without even changing the main contents of the site, dynamically. 
And this is something we may do as a group on our wordpress website where one or more of us focuses on the presentation of the site while everyone else works on the content.
