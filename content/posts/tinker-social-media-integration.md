# Tinker with Social Media Integration in Hugo
## Christopher Frondal

Today we got to mess with the header/navigation bar by adding a social media follow integration. All of the related code for the header is contained within the config file
in the website folder so that the header can be referenced on every individual webpage to be accessible across the site. I found this part to be pretty straight forward, functioning similar to adding a navigation bar to a website using html and php.
The only thing I will have to practice with is learning the syntax for this in hugo, which shouldn't be much of a problem.
