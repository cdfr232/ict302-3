# Tinker with Social Media Integration in Hugo
## Christopher Frondal

Today we got to mess with the header/navigation bar by adding a social media follow integration. All of the related code for the header is contained within the config file
in the website folder so that the header can be referenced on every individual webpage to be accessible across the site. I found this part to be pretty straight forward, functioning similar to adding a navigation bar to a website using html and php.
The only thing I will have to practice with is learning the syntax for this in hugo, which shouldn't be much of a problem.

This ties in to our discussion of content channels in that we can use our website to link different communication and information channels, acting as a way to link users to different communities efficiently and in a user friendly way short of just posting a link in a discussion post. Using the social media integration for linking content channels allows the link to be accessible and in a visually appealing way via the navigation bar so that users are more likely to see and explore other content channels.
