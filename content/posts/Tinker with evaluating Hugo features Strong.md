After messing with the Hugo features. I believe Hugo is more of a platform because you have to build Hugo from the ground up. You have to build something up before you can get a product. I rememeber an early conversation in the semester and we said Hugo is an open source. Hugo is one of more popular open-sources in the world. 

I believe Hugo is content delivery because people create content to deliver to others so people can learn from it. But again it can be content management because you have to manage the content that goes on your website. I would say Hugo is installed. Hugo is more on the code features side then the content features. WordPress is more on the content features side. This one is the same way, changes through code is more Hugo compared to changes through configuration, which is more WordPress. 

Hugo in my eyes is bidirectional publishing because it is always good to have many people to work on a website compared to only one person running a website. And finally Hugo is practicality because a website does not have to look elegant.
