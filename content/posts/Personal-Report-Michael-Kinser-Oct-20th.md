I can manage content using established workflows. This week our group is heavily focusing on getting our content finished. This is really the last things that we are working on to finish up. Along with that we were looking at how different CMS's have there benefits and drawbacks. With that said we look at Hugo and essentially what is has to offer according to certain definition given in class. Knowing these can help you know which CMS's is better and how you can implement them best into the workflow that you have created. Our group specifically is using a very individualized work flow to get the content done on our website. This is working well for our group since it would be a bit redundant to have more than one person working on one section of the website also since you can't edit the same page on Wordpress at the same time this makes it much easier to have everything separated between us.
