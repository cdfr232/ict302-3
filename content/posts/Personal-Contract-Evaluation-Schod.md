Going through my personal contract, I believe that I deserve a B grade. I have had a few times where I have not showed up but I always let my groupmates know before and I try to never miss days that we have groupwork on. I have contributed content so far such as helpig make the wordpress site in the format that it's currently in as well as making my own posts to add to the site. I do feel like I have a bit more to add but I believe it isn't bad work. I sometimes can take a second to contact my group memebers back but I usually always give a response within a few hours. For these reasons, looking back on my revised contract, I think that I deserve a B.
