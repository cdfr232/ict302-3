This week we learned about presentations of content on social media. Also learned about the themes on Hugo. We practiced this in the tinkering activity on Wednesday when we added the themes to the local servers. While practicing we figured that there are many ways we can make a website look good. No matter if it is Hugo, WordPress, or Wix. The process we are making so far is good. While we could be further, but we are happy where we are at the moment.
