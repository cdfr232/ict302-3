This week we have a good grasp on our idea of what we will be working on. While we have not gotten a complete workflow set up we do have the framing for a good system with a teams group set up and the resources that come with it. Britt and Michael are setting up a proposed workflow that can be edited and revised when the rest of the group is together and able to approve or deny any thing that is in it. Other than that we are just organizing and getting ourselves prepared to start working on the Wordpress website.
