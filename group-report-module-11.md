This week we learned about extending content management systems and Hugo developer tools. We practiced tinkering with the Hugo tools on Wednesday. We were testing out the search bar and comments feature. We could implement both of those features on the website. We will likely add a search bar. It takes a major effort to put both of those on the website. Hoping we will start putting information on the website nex week.
