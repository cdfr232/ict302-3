Already, i can say WordPress is super easier than Hugo. I see why so manhy website use WordPress comapred to Hugo. The whole process is easier, writing it, editing it, and publishing it. Hugo is file creation, lists and general website knowledge. Then on WordPress, you can edit on the drafts. It reminds me of Wix but it is still easier. It will be great not using github as much, not that it is bad. Just being able to edit on one website is easier instead of using multiple apps.
